{% set introParagraphs = "<p>Welcome to the Tailored Fit Pricing for IBM Z content solution, your homepage for technical resources.</p>
<p>Tailored Fit Pricing for IBM ZÂ® is designed to deliver unmatched simplicity, transparency, and predictability of pricing in this era of hybrid cloud.</p>
<p>Tailored Fit Pricing for IBM Z includes several comprehensive alternatives to the rolling four-hour average, including the Software Consumption Solution (formerly known as the Enterprise Consumption Solution), which uses cloud-like consumption-based licensing, the Hardware Consumption Solution, which offers a usage-based capacity corridor for unplanned spikes in demand, and the Application Development and Test Solution, a workload-specific solution that can coexist alongside both traditional and the new consumption models. Other solutions are the Enterprise Capacity Solution, a full-capacity licensing model that offers maximum predictability and simplicity, and the New Application Solution, which allows new applications to be tightly integrated with colocated workloads.</p>
<p>All of these solutions dramatically simplify pricing and deliver flexible deployment options that are tailored to reflect your environment. They allow you to embrace the best technical fit, greatly reducing need to architect for software costs.</p>
<p>Technology in z/OS provides the framework to enable Tailored Fit Pricing. It provides the capability to meter and report on specific workloads in a similar manner, regardless of the solution deployed. This can be done without manual tagging and tracking or other increased monthly overhead.</p>
<p>You can get started with Tailored Fit Pricing with minimal up-front setup.</p>" %}
