In fact, zDIH has been shown to accelerate time to value by 40% for hybrid cloud applications that consume core system application information.</p>
                <p>These zDIH caches can also serve business analysts on demand with information from core systems without impacting production systems.  Using current information in a self-service model can enable business analysts to more quickly resolve client issues.</p>

                <p>During a PoC, your use case is implemented and optimized using your test data.</p>
                <p>Throughout the PoC, your stakeholders validate the implementation and output to ensure the 
                PoC meets your needs. Participation in a collaborative PoC grows your team's skills in zDIH.</p>
                <p>At the end of the PoC you have:
                <ul>
                <li>An implemented use case that you can quickly deploy in your environment.</li>
                <li>Java applications to prime the zDIH cache and maintain cache currency. 
                These applications are aligned to your use case but can also provide the foundation 
                for additional use cases.</li>
                <li>Recommended configurations, tuning, and best practices for rapid deployment.</li>
                <li>Design documentation of your implemented use case.</li>
                <li>Knowledge transfer of the PoC assets.</li>
                </ul>
