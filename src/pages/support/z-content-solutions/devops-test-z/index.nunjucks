Investment in good application-specific test tools is required, as well, to enable best practices like shift-left testing, where unit and application integration testing occur earlier in the pipeline process, allowing problems to be discovered sooner.</p>
<p>z/OS® application testers lack quality tools and readily available infrastructure to quickly and comprehensively test complex multi-tier, hybrid applications. Better tools are needed for teams to apply best practices to deliver quality products to production.</p>
<p>Learn how IBM® solutions for automated, shift-left testing can help deliver higher quality Z-powered, hybrid applications. Benefit significantly from reduced risk and costs, and confidently deliver to production faster whether providing new capabilities or hot fixes to those mission-critical applications.</p>" %}

Test automation uses tools that include powerful test frameworks to programmatically execute test cases as soon as code is delivered including verifying and recording results.
