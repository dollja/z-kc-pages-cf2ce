Use it to improve your application design by creating JSON key:value databases on z/OS and take advantage of the advanced data sharing capabilities provided by IBM® Parallel Sysplex® technology.</p>
<p>With EzNoSQL you can easily create and access JSON databases through a comprehensive set of C- or Java-based APIs. The data can be shared from multiple application instances running on different processors, and EzNoSQL provides all the necessary serialization to protect the data.</p>
<p>Worried about having to code for eventual consistency with traditional NoSQL databases? Not with EzNoSQL’s single instance of the data. Data integrity and performance are met with EzNoSQL’s store-through caching design, in-memory buffering, and easy horizontal scaling. Let EzNoSQL be the database of choice to meet the growing demands of your application.</p>
<p>EzNoSQL is available with required service on z/OS 2.4 and above.</p>" %}

*NEW FOR CARBON*
iconPath: Pictograms must be added as SVG paths. The <svg> enclosing tag is already included in the template (layout-dot-com, line 333), with its necessary styles and classes, so this will be the inner content excluding that and starting with <g>, <path>, <polygon>, etc. Open svg file in VS code to grab path. Any custom pictograms should be made following Carbon guidelines and grid at 32px x 32px.

iconUrl: Full link to the pictogram used for this step. *NO LONGER NEEDED IN CARBON, but can still be added for reference to the source file for the path.
iconAlt: Alt text on pictogram for accessibility
